## Introduction

The QR Code API allows users to generate QR codes by making HTTP requests. It leverages FastAPI for handling API requests and responses, ensuring high performance and ease of use.

## Features

- Generate QR codes from text input.
- Retrieve QR codes in various formats.
- Scalable deployment using Docker and Nginx.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkashDeore15/qr-_code_api.git
   cd qr-_code_api
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the FastAPI Application:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. **Generate a QR Code:**

   Send a POST request to the `/generate` endpoint with the text you want to encode. For example, using `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Hello, World!"}'
   ```

   This will return a JSON response containing the QR code image.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure that the FastAPI application is not running when executing the tests, as they may use the same resources.

## Deployment

The project includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment.

1. **Build and Start the Containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will start the FastAPI application behind an Nginx reverse proxy.

2. **Access the API:**

   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To add new functionality:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature.
3. Implement your changes and ensure tests pass.
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.
